#Example AC Config
#Example AC uses actions.
#
##################################################################################################
#Example of an action:
#
#actions: cancel:example notify %player% is using %hack%:vl%=3:example message r u using %hack% m8?:vl==5:example kick %player% %tag% st0p h4ck1ng n00b:example broadcast %player% has been kicked for using %hack%.
#
#In this usage, it will cancel all violations and notify admins. If violation is equal or more than 3, it will send message to player. If violation is equal to 5, it will kick him.
#
#Use ':' character for multiple commands. If you want to use it in message or something else, use '\:' character.
#
#Operators to check violation:
#== (equal to)
#> (greater than)
#< (less than)
#>= (greater than or equal to)
#<= (less than or equal to)
#
#Available placeholders: %player%, %tag%, %vl%, %ping%, %tps%, %hack%, %module%â€‹ or %offset% (offset only applies to a command. Example: /example notify RERERE is using speeeeeeed!!!! 
#"RERERE is using speeeeeeed!!!!" would be the offset.)
